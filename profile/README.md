# PeduliTernak

The Peduli Ternak app is a "Disease Detection in Cattle" application that addresses a critical concern in the livestock farming sector by leveraging advanced AI technologies to enhance livestock farming practices. Livestock farming, especially cattle farming, plays a pivotal role in the economy and food supply chain. However, diseases among cattle (cow) herds pose a significant threat, which is shortage of beef supply, leading to beef imports and food security issues. Traditional methods of disease detection are often time-consuming and less accurate.
